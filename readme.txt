== Build ==

	Initially one has to use the static makefile to build Koralle:
		
		make
	
	If the build was successfull one can use Koralle to generate build-scripts
	by using
	
		node build/koralle.js
	
	This will write the generated makefile to stdout; you can redirect it in
	order to save and execute it (of course you should not overwrite the static
	makefile), e.g.:
	
		node build/koralle.js > makefile_generated
	
	The contents of the static and the generated makefiles should be
	the same. The following command will then build Koralle using Koralles
	GNU Make output:
	
		make --file=makefile_generated
	
	For Apache Ant this would be:
	
		node build/koralle.js --target=ant > build.xml && ant
		

== Examples ==

	Koralle itself is built using Koralle. Looking through the project.json,
	one can get an idea about the general syntax.
